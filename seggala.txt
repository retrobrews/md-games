Arcade Shooter Game 	
A Galaga clone. 

The objective of game is to score as many points as possible by destroying enemies. 
The player controls a starfighter that can move left and right along the bottom of 
the playfield. Enemies swarm in groups in a formation near the top of the screen, 
and then begin flying down toward the player, firing bullets at and attempting to 
crash into them. In later stages, some enemies even break from an entering group 
in a frantic attempt to crash into the player. The game ends when the player's 
last fighter is lost by colliding with an enemy, being hit by an enemy shot, 
or being captured.
